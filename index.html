    <p>My name is <strong>Yuan</strong> and I am a first year graphic design student at <em>Algonquin College</em>. I am passionate about art and design. After completing my first semester, I developed lots of useful design skills that will help me succeed in my design career. I have never done coding before I got into this class, hence I am really excited to learn to build my own website. I am also really into crafting and pottery to express my creativity. </p>

    <p>In my spare time, I like playing video games. I also like reading comic books and watching random videos on Youtube. I have a pet dog named Rocky and I enjoy going on a walk with him. My favorite food is fried dumplings and I enjoy making them at home. I love going to local metal and punk shows with my friends to see some of our favorite bands playing. </p>
